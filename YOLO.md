## YOLO: 
- **YOLO is a real-time object recognition system that can recognize multiple objects in a single frame**
- YOLO = you only look once
- It can predict 9000 classes and unseen classes
- YOLO is based on a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN divides an image into regions and then it predicts the boundary boxes and probabilities for each region.
- It simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and probabilities for those classes
- YOLO is developed by Joseph Redmon: 2016
- CSPDarkNet53
- YOLO versions: YOLOv1, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, PP-YOLO
