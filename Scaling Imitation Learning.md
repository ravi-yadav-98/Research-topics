--------------------------------------------------------------------
### Summary:
#### Keywords Definition
- *MineCraft* ---> Video Game (Most played)
- *Mine* *RL* --->  AI/Machine Learning for solving Minecraft game (Reinforment Learning techniques)
- *Imitation Learning* --> Imitation Learning is a framework for learning a behavior policy from demonstrations. 
    - Transfering human knowledge about the world to the RL agent
    - Learning from Demonstrations
    - The idea of Imitation Learning is implicitly giving an agent prior information about the world by mimicking human behavior in some sense
